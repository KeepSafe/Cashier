In order of priority

- Fake checkout theme is mispelled
- Use auto parcelable instead of manually maintaining that
- Local signature check
- Implement Amazon billing
- Write tests for all classes
- Improve Logger
- RxJava extension

Maybe

- Headless fragment to handle onActivityResult (since thats apparently fixed now...)
